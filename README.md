# Case Study: Power Query, Power Automate, and Power BI

## Description
This case study was a part of my interview process, where I was asked to generate my own data, combine three different tables using Power Query, automate a mail merge to customers using Power Automate, and finally visualize the data using Power BI. Below is a video of my presentation where I explain my findings and demonstrate the process.

## Technologies Used:
- **Microsoft Power Query**: For combining and transforming data.
- **Microsoft Power Automate**: For automating email communications with customers.
- **Microsoft Power BI**: For creating interactive data visualizations.
