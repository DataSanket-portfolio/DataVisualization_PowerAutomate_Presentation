# Case Study: Power Query, Power Automate, and Power BI

## Description
This case study was a part of my interview process, where I was asked to generate my own data, combine three different tables using Power Query, automate a mail merge to customers using Power Automate, and finally visualize the data using Power BI. Below is a video of my presentation where I explain my findings and demonstrate the process.

## ðŸ“Š Power BI Dashboard
The final dashboard was built using Power BI.

## ðŸ§¾ Data Tables

Below are the three tables I created for this case study. These were later merged using Power Query to form the final dataset.

### Table 1: Order Information
This table contains customer information such as customer ID, name, and contact details.

## Summary of Steps
1. **Data Creation**: Generated three realistic datasets for order, product price, and discount information.
2. **Data Merging**: Used Power Query to clean and merge the datasets based on keys.
3. **Email Automation**: Built a Power Automate flow to send personalized order summaries to each customer.
4. **Visualization**: Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze sales and customer trends.
