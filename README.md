# Case Study: Power Query, Power Automate, and Power BI

## Description
This case study was a part of my interview process, where I was asked to generate my own data, combine three different tables using Power Query, automate a mail merge to customers using Power Automate, and finally visualize the data using Power BI. Below is a video of my presentation where I explain my findings and demonstrate the process.
